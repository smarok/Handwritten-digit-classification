Handwritten digit classification GUI which can recognize handwritten digits with help of Deep Learning (Convolutional Neural Network).
This project consists of 3 files: GUI.py, Model.py and digit_classification.h5

(you just need to run GUI.py in order to launch the project)

1. GUI.py: It contains code for GUI application which allows user draw digit with cursor and displays predicted digit along with accuracy.

2. Model.py: It contains code for training a simple Convolutional neural network or CNN which uses the MNST training data set. It saves the trained model for later use.

3. digit_classification.h5: This is the trained deep learning model which we load in GUI.py file.
